# ParadiseClipper
A simple and easily scalable Crypto Clipper (made for educational purposes)

This is a small project I started (and made in 5 minutes) just because someone on discord reminded me that crypto clippers are a thing.
It was made purely for educational purposes and for fun.

Use at your own risk!
